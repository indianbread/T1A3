## Functionality / features ##

* Navigation menu at the top of the page with a home button and links to the pages. The navigation menu will remain the same on all pages.

* The blog will have a sidebar on the right hand side with the links to all the blog posts.

## Target audience ##

This website is targeted towards industry peers, reruiters and potential employers. They can use this website to find out more about me and gain a better understanding of my skills and coding ability.

## Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc) ##

This website is coded using only HTML and CSS. The website documents are version controlled using a Git repository and published to Github. 
The website was deployed using Netlify by linking Netlify to the Github repository.

## Design Process ##

1. Collate different website designs into a moodboard for inspiration using Dribbble. 
2. Mock up sketches of each page using pen and paper based on moodboard inspired designs. Took note of design name so I can go        back and refer to them later when building detailed components.
3. Create list & checklist in Trello
4. Look on coolers for colour theme
5. Write down site map
6. Construct wireframes in Figma based off sketches
7. Construct site map using Lucidchart
8. Make a template page to get a feel for the design and code the 'base' body layout and containers
9. Copy and paste the template for each page and code each page using html and css simultaneously.
